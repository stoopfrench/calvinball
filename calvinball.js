            Calvinball (http://www.picpak.net/calvin/oldsite/images/oogy.gif) is a game with a very complicated scoring system. Your job is to write a piece of code which determines a player's final score, given their starting scrore, and various other details about the player which are relevant to the game. 

            Provided below are three different player's starting scores. Uncomment one at a time to calculate the final score for that player.

            Calvinball Rules:
                1. A player's score is equal to 500 if their score is not already a number. (this is implemented below).
                2. A player's score is reduced by 300 if they are crying. Otherwise it is increased by 50.
                3. A player's score is reduced by 77 if their last play was "Q"
                4. A player gets an extra 395 points if they are in a tree, unless their last play was a number.
                5. A player's score is doubled if they are holding the broom handle, but it is tripled if they have the broom brush. Otherwise the player's score is halved.
                6. A player's score is multiplied by 1.5 if they are carrying the ball but only if they are not in a tree. Disregard this rule if the player is crying.
                7. If the player's last play was a number (not a letter), the player's score is multiplied by that amount.
